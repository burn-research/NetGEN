% PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS RETENTION

% Now we have to select the principal components that have to be retained
% to describe the data. The following guidelines have been proposed: 
% 1) TOTAL VARIANCE: We can retain the eigenvalues needed to account for a
% specific percentage of the total variance (i.e. 80%). The required number
% of PCs is then the smallest value of m for which this chosen percentage
% is exceeded. 
% 2) INDIVIDUAL VARIANCE: We can retain the components whose eigenvalues
% are greater than the average of the eigenvalues (Kaiser, 1960) or than
% 0.7 times he average of the eigenvalues (Joliffe 1972). For a correlation
% matrix this average equals 1. 
% 3) BROKEN STICK MODEL: We can select the retained PCs according to the
% Broken Stick Model
% 4) SCREE GRAPH: We can use the scree graph, a plot of the 
% eigenvalues agaist their indexes, and look for a natural break between
% the large and small eigenvalues. 
% 5) SIGNIFICANCE TEST: We can perform a test of significance of the larger
% eigenvalues. 

% STOP RULE 1 - CUMULATIVE PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL VARIATION

% Perhaps the most obvious criterion for choosing the PCs to be retained is
% to select a (cumulative) percentage of total variation which one desires
% that the selected PCs contribute, say 80% or 90%. The required number of
% PCs is then the smallest value of m for which this chosen percentage is
% exceeded.

% STOP RULE 2 - Size of Variances of Principal Components

% The previous rule is equally valid whether a covariance or a correlation
% matrix is used to compute the PCs. The rule described in this section is
% constructed specifically for use with correlation matrices, although it
% can be adapted for some types of covariance matrices. The idea behind the
% rule is that if all elements of x are independent, then the PCs are the
% same as the original variables and all have unit variances in the case of
% a correlation matrix. Thus any PC with variance less than 1 contains less
% information than one of the original variables and so is not worth
% retaining. The rule, in its simplest form, is sometimes called Kaiserï¿½s
% rule (Kaiser, 1960) and retains only those PCs whose variances lk exceed
% 1. It can be argued that a cut-off at lk = 1 retains too few variables.
% Consider a variable which, in the population, is more-or-less independent
% of all other variables. In a sample, such a variable will have small
% coefficients in (p - 1) of the PCs but will dominate one of the PCs,
% whose variance will be close to 1 when using the correlation matrix. As
% the variable provides independent information from the other variables it
% would be unwise to delete it. However, deletion will occur if Kaiserï¿½s
% rule is used, and if, due to sampling variation, lk < 1. It is therefore
% advisable to choose a cut-off lower than 1, to allow for sampling
% variation. Jolliffe (1972) suggested, based on simulation studies, that
% 0.7 is roughly the correct level.

% STOP RULE 3 - BROKEN STICK MODEL

% broken into p segments, then it can be shown that the expected
% length of the kth longest segment is:
% 
% lambda* = sum(1/j)/p j = k:p
% 
% One way of deciding whether the proportion of variance accounted for by
% the kth PC is large enough for that component to be retained is to
% compare the proportion with lambda*. Principal components for which the
% proportion exceeds lambda* are then retained, and all other PCs deleted.

% STOP RULE 4 - SCREE PLOT

% One way to determine the number of eigenvalues to retain is to look at
% the scree graph,which is simply the plot of the eigenvalues sorted in
% descrnding order against their indexes. The number of eigenvalues to
% retain is based on the observation of the index k at which the slopes of 
% lines joining the plotted points are ï¿½steepï¿½ to the left of k, and 
% ï¿½not steepï¿½ to the right of it. This value of k, defining an ï¿½elbowï¿½ 
% in the graph, is then taken to be the number of components to be
% retained. The formalization of this tecnique would require to look at the
% difference between l(k) - l(k-1) and to check when it becomes fairly 
% constant. This tecnique requires some degree of judgment and it is used
% in a mainly graphical way.

        ret_eigvec(:, i) = sort_eigvec(:,i);
    end
end

% STOP RULE 5 - TEST OF SIGNIFICANCE OF THE LARGER EIGENVALUES

% The number of PCs to retain can be also decided  with a test of
% significance of the larger components. we test the hyphothesis that the
% last k population eigenvalues are small and equal. The implication is
% that the first sample components capture all the essential dimensions,
% whereas the last components reflect noise. H0k = yp-k+1 = yp-k+2 = ... =
% yp where y are the eigenvalues of the covariance matrix. If H0 is true
% the last components will tend to form a straight line with small slope in
% the scree graph plot. To test Hok we use a likelihood approach based on
% the average of the last eigenvalues of the covariance matrix.
%
% ave(lp-k+1) = sum(lp-k+1/k)
% 
% Then we test the statistic
% 
% u = (n-(2p+11)/6)*(k ln(ave(lp-k+1))-sum(lnlp-k+1))
%
% which has an approximate chi square distribution. We reject H0 if
% u>=chi_square(alpha, degrees of freedom). The parameter alpha is the
% confidence level parameter used to find the critical chi-square value. To
% carry out the procedure we start by testing H02. If the test is accepted
% we then test H03 and so on until a test is rejected for some value of k.
% The procedure tends to retain more PCs than are really necessary. For
% correlation matrices, Jolliffe (1970) found that the rule often
% corresponds roughly to choosing a cut-off of about 0.1 to 0.2, which is
% much smaller than both Kaiser and Joliffe criteria. Moreover, it is easy
% to construct examples where the method gives silly answers. For instance,
% if there is one near-constant relationship among the elements of x, with
% a much smaller variance than any other PC, then the procedure rejects
% H0,p-2 and declares that all PCs need to be retained, regardless of how
% nearly equal are the next few eigenvalues.
